# ChatRooms-Firebase
  
  **A small project as a result of studies.**
  The chat room is a simple chat widget that uses Firebase. There are several chat rooms where you can have a conversation. Each room is *according to a specific theme* and will thus serve as a concise and documented base for chat products built on Firebase, and in addition is easy to expand.
 
## Status
This project is for educational purposes and personal curiosity.
